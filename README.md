For product database, it will automatically create the database
Therefore, you just have to insert the data into the table
Use the producttb.sql file to copy the insert into table 
```sql
"INSERT INTO Producttb (product_name, product_price, product_image)
        VALUES ('Apple MacBook Pro',1799,'./upload/product1.png'),
                        ('Sony E7 Headphones',147,'./upload/product2.png'),
                        ('Sony Xperia Z4',459,'./upload/product3.png'),
                        ('Samsung Galaxy A50',278,'./upload/product4.png')";
```
